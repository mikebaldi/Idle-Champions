# IC Script Hub
Welcome to 2022 and happy new year!  
New year, new script. We hope you like it.   
  
This script is the successor to ModronGUI.  

### Warning:
This script reads system memory. I do not know CNE's stance on reading system memory used by the game, so use at your own risk. Pointers may break on any given update and I may no longer decide to update them.  


# Instructions:
1. Read and familiarize yourself with all topics covered in Maviin's FAQ: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ek-66HsOT3VABWdBNh-5iMOSd7UP5ssTRjgS4xkO1To/edit#
2. Download and install AutoHotkey: https://www.autohotkey.com/
3. Download all files by clicking the `Code` button on github and then clicking "Download Zip". Extract **all** files from the zip to a directory of your choosing.
    * Occasionally, I may upload different versions of IC_MemoryFunctions.AHK for different versions of IC. Any Memory Function file with `_v###` has not been tested with the script by me and only tested for accurate memory reads. The file will need to be renamed, deleting the `_v###` portion.
4. Scan all downloaded files with trusted antivirus software.
5. Updating `Settings.json` with correct location to your game.
6. Right click Launcher.AHK and select run script.

## Recommended Additional Steps:
Review AutoHotkey tutorials and documentation.  
**Review README.md files included with each AddOn in ./AddOns/ folder.**
