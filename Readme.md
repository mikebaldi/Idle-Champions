# IC Script Hub
## ``New:``
Script Hub has been updated for use with and with antilectual's [ScriptHub-AutomaticOffsets](https://github.com/antilectual/ScriptHub-AutomaticOffsets). See the the linked repo for instructions on how to use it to update Script Hub's offsets.

## Introduction

> "This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill—the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill—you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember: all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more."

Welcome to 2022 and Happy New Year!  

New year, new script. We hope you like it.   
  
This script is the successor to ModronGUI.

**Warning**:
This script reads system memory. I do not know CNE's stance on reading system memory used by the game, so use at your own risk. Pointers may break on any given update and I may no longer decide to update them.

**Warning2**:
CNE will at times push out multiple patches during the week, changing classes and thus their structure in memory. This can change offsets which will break memory reading functions. It is advised you disable auto updates and keep a back up of a working Assembly-CSharp.dll from your install folder. Offsets will likely only be updated on weekends and not necessarily every weekend.

## Prerequisites

You need AutoHotKey installed to be able to use `IC Script Hub`. The version of AutoHotKey installed also needs to support the switch command. 

[Download AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

It is recommended that you set up Git and pull `IC Script Hub` via Git. 

This will be the easiest way for you to keep up to date with any changes made in the future. There is a little bit more to do upfront, but you will save so much time in the long run (kinda like scripting the game in the first place).

You may use any Git client you wish. [Here is a step-by-step guide](docfiles/getting-started-with-ic-script-hub-using-git.md) to installing and using Git Desktop with `IC Script Hub`.

If you would rather grab the latest version of the code manually, [head over here to learn how to do that](docfiles/getting-started-with-ic-script-hub-using-zip.md). I really don't recommend it though, as you will have to repeat this entire process every single time as opposed to simply opening an application and clicking a button.

## I know Git Fu!

You now have the latest version of `IC Script Hub` on your machine.

Let's go down the rabbit hole and see what awaits.

Where do you play the game?

[I play on Steam](docfiles/using-ic-script-hub-with-steam.md) 

[I play on EGS](docfiles/using-ic-script-hub-with-egs.md)
