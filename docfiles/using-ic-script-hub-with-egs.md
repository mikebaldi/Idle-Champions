# Setting Idle Champions game location for EGS

## Overview

The scripts inside `IC Script Hub` need to know where your game is installed.

## Opening `IC Script Hub`

Navigate to the folder you cloned the repo into using Windows Explorer. 

You can press `Ctrl+Shift+F` from within GitHub Desktop if you used that to clone the repository.

Double-click on `ICScriptHub.ahk` in the explorer window that opens to launch `IC Script Hub`.

You should see the `IC Script Hub` window and it should look something like this:
