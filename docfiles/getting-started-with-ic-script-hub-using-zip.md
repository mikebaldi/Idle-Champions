## Unzipping the Zip file to your local machine

Use your preferred method of extracting zip files to get all the files into a folder on your machine.

At minimum you can double click the downloaded file, click the `Extract all` button in Windows Explorer, and then pick a location to extract it.

## Getting updates from the repository

To get updates, you'll need to do the previous two steps every time a change is made that you want in your version. 

Remember to use the same location.

Sometimes there will be multiple updates a day. 

It's **strongly** recommended that you check out the process for [Getting started with IC Script Hub using Git](getting-started-with-ic-script-hub-using-git.md) because updating is so much quicker that way.
